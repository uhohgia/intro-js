/////// PREGUNTA 1

/*
Concepto de:

EventTarget Interface - top of the chain, does not inherit properties or methods
Node Interface - inherits properties and methods from event target
Element interface - inherits properties and methods from node

*/


/*
Think about these interfaces:

EventTarget
Node
Element
Is there a difference between these two:

document.addEventListener()
myHeading.addEventListener() (assume the myHeading variable is an element)


My answer: "myHeading is an element instead of a node like document"
